Welcome to a post-mortem of an interview. I wasn't able to properly function as an engineer and as a result my performance was lacking:

Lessons learned:
- Sleep is crucial towards a good performance.
- We still have a long way battling anxiety here.
- Abstraction is a bitch.
- Failures are natural and I have to learn how to accept them.

#TODO

- Partitioning and Tomcat
- Improve execution structure
